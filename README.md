# Tutorials on Deep Generative Models in Transportation Research
This repository contains tutorials demonstrating the use of deep generative models in transportation research, as presented in the paper "_A Gentle Introduction and Tutorial on Deep Generative Models in Transportation Research_". 
The examples provided focus on two foundational data in transportation research: 1) travel survey data and 2) highway speed contour data. Each example is designed to help researchers in the transportation field apply generative models to their own projects.

All code is provided in Python Jupyter Notebook format and can be executed in Google Colab for easy access and experimentation.

## Travel Survey Data Generation Example (TravelSurvey folder; Section 4.1 in the paper)
In this example, we present the generation of synthetic travel survey data using deep generative models.
